N The Police is a band, not a law enforcement agency. Band members do not have the legal authority to make arrests.
Y In the United Kingdom, where The Police originated, police officers are authorized to make lawful arrests. However, the term 'The Police' in this context refers to the band, not actual law enforcement officers. If we consider the band members as 'police' in a fictional or humorous sense, then yes, they could perform lawful arrests in that context. But in reality, only trained and authorized law enforcement officers can make lawful arrests.
N Members of The Police are police officers themselves, but they do not have inherent additional powers beyond their formal roles. Arresting powers comes from their role as law enforcement officials within the police force.

N An Iwato scale is a 12-tone scale, so it could be used in a 12-tone technique composition.
N An Iwato scale is a type of Japanese musical scale, but it's not inherently incompatible with twelve-tone technique. Twelve-tone technique involves the use of all 12 half-steps within an octave in a specific order, and an Iwato scale can be adapted or modified to fit within this framework. However, it would likely require significant modification to fit the strict requirements of twelve-tone technique.
Y The Iwato scale is a traditional Japanese five-note scale, which does not have the necessary twelve tones for a twelve-tone technique composition.
ANSWER 1 AND 2 ARE EQUAL, ASKING 3
Y An Iwato scale could potentially be used within the framework of a 12-tone composition since it includes all twelve notes of the chromatic scale (albeit with some duplications). However, as noted in your statement, significant modifications would likely be necessary to make it comply with the strict rules of dodecaphonic music or Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique.

N The Gulf of Finland is a relatively shallow and brackish sea. The conditions there, including fluctuating salinity and water temperature, would not be ideal for the long-term preservation of a large ship like the Titanic.
N The Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately 370 miles (600 km) off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The Gulf of Finland is located in the Baltic Sea, between Estonia and Finland. The conditions at the bottom of the Gulf of Finland are not suitable for preserving the Titanic, as it is a shallow and relatively warm body of water compared to the North Atlantic, which would lead to faster degradation of the wreck.
N The Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean, not in the Gulf of Finland. The shipping conditions are very different, so it would not be preserved similarly.
