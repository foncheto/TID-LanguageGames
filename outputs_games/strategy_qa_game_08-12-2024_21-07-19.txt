No: 'Robert Wadlow', who was the tallest person in recorded history, stood at about 8 feet 11 inches. However, he passed away before Mary Shelley's fictional character, 'Frankenstein's monster', was created (1818). As such, there is no realistic scenario where they would meet.

Would it be impossible to use an Iwato scale for a twelve-tone technique composition?
The correct answer is: yes
Initial answers:
No: While traditionally associated with serialism and its elaboration of pre-existing scales, twelve-tone technique doesn't inherently restrict the choice of intervals or scales used in its construction. An Iwato scale could theoretically be employed within a twelve-tone framework.
No: The Iwato scale is a type of Japanese scale, but it's not inherently incompatible with twelve-tone technique. Twelve-tone technique involves the use of all 12 tones of the chromatic scale in a specific order, and the Iwato scale can be adapted or used within this framework. However, it would require careful manipulation and reordering of the Iwato scale's tones to fit the twelve-tone technique's requirements.
Yes: An Iwato scale is not a predefined musical scale like the 12-tone equal temperament system used in traditional western music. It consists of Japanese Koto intervals, which are not compatible with the structure of the 12-tone technique.

Would a Pict be confused by Old English?
The correct answer is: yes
Initial answers:
Yes: Picts existed in what is now Scotland from roughly the 3rd to 9th centuries AD. Old English, on the other hand, was spoken in what is now England from roughly the 5th to late 12th centuries.  Therefore, they would have spoken different languages.
No: Although the Picts were a pre-English culture in Scotland, Old English was spoken in England. The Picts spoke a Celtic language, but they may have been familiar with Old English due to cultural exchange and trade. However, it's unlikely they would be confused by it, as it would be a distinct language from their own.
Yes: The Picts were an ancient Scottish civilization that inhabited parts of modern-day Scotland, primarily in the northern and western areas. Their written language, known as Ogham—an early form of writing using notched marks inscribed on standing stones—predates the Old English period (which covers roughly from the 5th to the 12th centuries).

Did Japanese serfdom have higher status than English counterpart?
The correct answer is: yes
Initial answers:
No: Japanese peasantry, while tied to the land, had more rights and less rigid social stratification compared to English serfs.  Japanese peasants (farmers) could theoretically own land (though not always outright) and even move freely. English serfs, however, were legally bound to the land owned by their lord  and had very limited freedoms.
No: In Japan, the status of serfs was generally lower than that of the samurai class, while in England, serfs were at the bottom of the social hierarchy, with little social mobility or status.
No: In both Japanese feudalism and English feudalism, the serfs/peasants were lower in status compared to the ruling classes. However, Japanese serfs might have had slightly less freedom compared to English ones due to stricter land ownership rules (though comparing the two systems as a whole is complex as they existed in different historical periods with different societal structures).

QUESTION N°87
Could ten gallons of seawater crush a six year old?
The correct answer is: yes
Initial answers:
No: While seawater is heavy, ten gallons wouldn't be enough to crush a six-year-old.  The weight would be significant, but not enough to cause fatal crushing force.
No: The weight of ten gallons of seawater would be around 94-97 pounds, considering the density of seawater is about 64 pounds per cubic foot. Air displacement in water compressibility comes into play when submerged yet such pressure will not suffice to crush a six-year-old as the force required would likely be in the range to cause that level depth within human pressure scope in water.
No: Seawater does not have the density to exert enough pressure to crush a human body. However, it is important to note that consuming large amounts of seawater can lead to hyponatremia, which is a dangerous condition caused by low sodium levels in the blood.
