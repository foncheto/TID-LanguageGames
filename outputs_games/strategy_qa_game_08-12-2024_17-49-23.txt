QUESTION N°0
Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?
The correct answer is: yes
Initial answers:
Yes: Genghis Khan had a vast empire and many children, leading to a significant number of descendants. While Julius Caesar also had descendants, his empire was smaller and his genealogical spread is less extensive.
Yes: Genghis Khan is estimated to have a large number of descendants due to his many wives and children. Studies suggest that around 1 in 200 people globally, including those with European ancestry, share a common recent ancestor with him. In contrast, Julius Caesar's known descendents are believed to be much fewer due to the uncertain nature of his family lineage after deaths in ancient times.
Yes: In modern times, it has been estimated that about 0.5% of the world population can trace their ancestry back to Genghis Khan due to his numerous offspring, while no proven genetic link exists between Julius Caesar's descendants and the general population.

QUESTION N°1
Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?
The correct answer is: no
Initial answers:
No: The Police are a musical group, not law enforcement officers. They do not have the legal authority to make arrests.
Yes: In the United Kingdom, where The Police originated, police officers are authorized to make lawful arrests. However, the term 'The Police' in this context refers to the band, not actual law enforcement officers. If we consider the band members as 'police' in a fictional or humorous sense, then yes, they could perform lawful arrests in that context. But in reality, only trained and authorized law enforcement officers can make lawful arrests.
No: 'The Police' is a band, not law enforcement officers. They do not have the authority to perform lawful arrests.
Conflict detected: 3 and 1 are equal, 2 is different

QUESTION N°2
Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?
The correct answer is: no
Initial answers:
No: Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.  MAO inhibitors are medications used to treat depression, but consuming them in candy form would be dangerous and ineffective. Depression is a complex condition requiring professional treatment.
No: Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are a type of medication used to treat depression, but they are not typically found in candy bars. Even if they were, consuming MAO inhibitors in a candy bar could be dangerous due to potential interactions with other foods or medications, and could exacerbate depression symptoms rather than alleviate them.
No: A Monoamine Oxidase candy bar does not exist. This question assumes the availability of such a product, which is not true in the real world. Moreover, even if it did exist, it is not appropriate to try treating depression, anxiety, or any psychiatric condition with candies or other foods.

Resolving conflict for LLM 3
Yes: Dogs have been domesticated for thousands of years and are trained to respond to various cues, including bells. Grey seals, on the other hand, being wild animals with different cognitive abilities and learning patterns, would not typically be trained or expected to respond consistently to human-made sounds like bells.

No: The Albany, NY metropolitan area is significantly larger than the Albany, GA metropolitan area.  It's highly unlikely that Albany, GA will ever reach even a fraction of its population.
No: Albany, Georgia, has a population of around 77,000, while Albany, New York, has a population of around 98,000. Albany, New York, is already larger than Albany, Georgia, and it's unlikely that Albany, Georgia, will reach 100,000 occupants before Albany, New York.
No: Albany, Georgia currently has a population of approximately 77,432 people (2019 data), while Albany, New York has a population of around 97,956 people (2018 data). Therefore, it is less likely for Albany in Georgia to reach a hundred thousand occupants before Albany in New York.

QUESTION N°8
Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?
The correct answer is: yes
Initial answers:
No: The cost of manufacturing a Boeing 737 is far greater than the worldwide box office gross of the Wonder Woman (2017) film. 
No: The production budget of the 2017 film Wonder Woman was approximately $149 million. The worldwide box office gross for the film was over $821 million. However, the cost of a Boeing 737 can range from $80 million to over $130 million, depending on the model and configuration. Therefore, the box office receipts of the film would not be sufficient to cover the cost of a Boeing 737.
No: 'Wonder Woman' (2017 film) box office receipts do not directly cover the cost of a Boeing 737 as the aircraft is not a prop that appears in the movie.
